// Bonus: Make it like Hangman:
//
// Keep track of all the guessed letters (right and wrong) and only let the
// user guess a letter once. If they guess a letter twice, do nothing.
//
// Keep track of the state of the hangman as a number (starting at 0),
// and subtract or add to that number every time they make a wrong guess.
//
// Once the number reaches 6 (a reasonable number of body parts for a
//  hangman), inform the user that they lost and show a hangman on the log.
