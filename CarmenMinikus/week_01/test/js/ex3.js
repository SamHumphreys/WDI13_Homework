//Problem here: repeating variables too many times, and they would have to be
//changed in two spots.

var cuisine1 = "Indian";
var cuisine2 = "Scottish";
var cuisine3 = "Szechuan";

console.log("I like "+ cuisine1 + ", " + cuisine2 + ", " + cuisine3);

//this is why you would need to create an array. A variables for many values.

var cuisine = ["Indian", "Scottish", "Szechuan"];
