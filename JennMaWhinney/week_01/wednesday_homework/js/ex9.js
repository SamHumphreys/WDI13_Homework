JavaScript Bank
In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript. The bank has many accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.

Bank

There is only one bank. This bank has an array of accounts.
The bank needs a method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts.
It also needs an addAccount method that will enroll a new account at the bank and add it to the array of accounts.
There is no need to create additional functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.

var bank = {
  var accounts = {
  name:["Jenn", "Vincent", "Anna"];
  idNumber: [1, 2, 3];
  amount:[200, 450, 320];}

var returnTotal = function(money){
  var total = 0;
  for(i = 0; i < amount.length; i++)
  total += amount[i];
  return total;
}
returnTotal(bank.accounts);

var addAccount = function(money){
  var bank.name = [];
  var bank.idNumber = [];
  var bank.account = [];
  var extra =
}
